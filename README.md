## Submitting a blog post

If you would like to upload an image for your blog post, please do the following:
1. Add the image to [the blog post images directory](/src/data/blog/posts/images).
1. Import the image in the [images manifest](/src/data/blog/posts/images/index.js), and give your image a unique reference name.
1. Insert the image in your markdown as you typically would, but instead of the file path use the reference name from the manifest. i.e. `![image alt text](myCoolImage)`.
