We would like to announce beta support for Linux arm64/aarch64. We are working diligently towards official releases and support for more operating systems. If you would like to test, please find beta packages for the 4.5.0 tag here:

They should follow the same portability expectations as x86, and work on any Linux distribution released since 2011.

Bugs and incompatibilities should be filled as GitHub [issues](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues) on the osquery repository. Questions, comments, and discussions are taking place in the Slack channel `#arm-architecture` ([request an invite!](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw))

And of course, if you would like to build osquery for aarch64 yourself, please follow our [building](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/building/) guide. But use the [aarch64](https://github.com/osquery/osquery-toolchain/releases/download/1.1.0/osquery-toolchain-1.1.0-aarch64.tar.xz) version of our toolchain.

A big thanks to everyone who made this possible, and specifically [artemist](https://github.com/artemist), [lizthegrey](https://github.com/lizthegrey), and [ozbenh](https://github.com/ozbenh).
