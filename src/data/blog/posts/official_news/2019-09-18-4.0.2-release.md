Osquery 4.0.2 has landed as the first stable release since the [transition of osquery project governance](./osquery-foundation) to the Linux Foundation. This marks a huge milestone as it introduces a number of core code refactors that were made by the Facebook team, and a revamped build system (largely developed by Trail of Bits engineers). Reaching this goal means that a regular release cadence can return for osquery.

Download 4.0.2 from [the Downloads page](../downloads/official/4.0.2). The extensive changelog is available on the [GitHub release page for 4.0.1](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases/tag/4.0.1).
