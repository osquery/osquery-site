Today we are excited to announce the creation of the osquery foundation. Please read the [Linux Foundation's official announcement](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/06/the-linux-foundation-announces-intent-to-form-new-foundation-to-support-osquery-community/). We have created an [osquery/foundation](https://github.com/osquery/foundation) repository on GitHub to host the technical charter.

The official repository has been renamed from `facebook/osquery` to [osquery/osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery).
