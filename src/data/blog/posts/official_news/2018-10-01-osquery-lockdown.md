Hi folks, we're freezing osquery development until the 19th November, so we can do a refactor on the build, test, and integration systems.  This means we won't be reviewing or accepting new pull requests during this period, and we won't be submitting code ourselves.

The osquery project has grown a lot over the past few years. Just this year, the Facebook team working on osquery has more than doubled. Our current infrastructure and workflows have reached a point at which they aren't scaling with the number of concurrent developers. We're not being as efficient as we could reviewing and accepting pull requests, and most importantly making sure the code we land is rock solid.

To address these challenges, we decided to redesign how we handle code review and testing. To make this work, we'll need to stop project development for a little while. We understand this can be disruptive, but our improvements are targeted at improving the long-term health and continued success of the osquery community. These changes will allow us to move faster with all contributions and ultimately make osquery better.

Thank you for your patience. We will keep you up to date on these changes and any adjustments to the timeline.
